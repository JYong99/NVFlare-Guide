Prerequisites:
1. Nvflare is installed
2. Completed provision and have the workspace generated
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Instructions:
1. Locate the startup kits

  Locate the startup kits of the clients which should be located in the workspace generated during provision.
  Example path: /workspace/example_project_name/prod_00/
  
  Depending on the number of clients configured, ensure that there are the same number of folders each named 
  after the clients' name configured in provision and contains the startup kit.

2. Transfer the folders to their respective client
  
  Gather the necessary client's information such as IP address and destination path.
  
  It is up to the project admin decision for the method of transferring the startup kits to the clients, 
  example methods such as using email or SCP to transfer the files.

  Ensure that all the clients received the correct startup kits.
