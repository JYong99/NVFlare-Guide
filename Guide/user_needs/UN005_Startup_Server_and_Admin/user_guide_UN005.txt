Steps to Startup the Server & Admin
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prerequisites:
1. Server & Admin Startup Kits Available
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Instructions:
1. Startup the necessary services

  ---Server---
  Find the start.sh script which should be located in the server's startup kit under startup, where the 
  startup kit's folder name is the server's 'name' configured during provision.
  Example path: /workspace/example_project_name/prod_00/DxD_Server/startup/start.sh

  Ensure that the sub_start.sh has execute access. If it does not, you can 
  run the command 'chmod +x /workspace/example_project_name/prod_00/DxD_Server/startup/sub_start.sh'

  Afterwards, run the command 'bash start.sh' and the Server service will startup.

  ---Admin---
  Ensure that the server service has already start before attempting to startup the admin service.

  Find the fl_admin.sh script which should be located in the admin's startup kit under startup, where the 
  startup kit's folder name is the server's 'name' configured during provision.
  Example path: /workspace/example_project_name/prod_00/admin@dxd.com/startup/fl_admin.sh

  Afterwards, run the command 'bash fl_admin.sh' and wait for the admin console to startup

  A prompt 'User Name:' will appear and you will have to input the admin's 'name' configured during provision
  which is in email format.

  The admin console will be available for use in the terminal after successfully logging in.
