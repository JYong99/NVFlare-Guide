Steps to Evaluate the Global XGBoost Model
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prerequisites:
1. Server, Admin & Clients services all started and successfully connected.
2. Clients have the csv dataset available and named after the clients' 'name'.
    -dataset: {site_name}.csv
3. Server has a existing XGBoost model.

Instructions:

There are a few configuration to be made on the job folder template provided, "xgboost_evaluate_global".

1. Edit job folder

  Similar to UN007 and UN008, ensure that the sites' name is the same as the ones configure during provision

  For the server config file, "config_fed_server", edit the model name in the variable "model_dir" but leave
  the "app_server/" part. For example, if the model name is "example_model.json", 
  model_dir = "app_server/example_model.json"

  Remember to have the model that you plan to evaluate in the server folder, which can be seen in the example 
  folder under the app_server.

  For all the clients' config file, "config_fed_client", edit the variable "csv_dir" to the path of the dataset
  for each client.

2. Submit job folder

  The job folder has to be submitted through the admin console to the server to start the evaluation process.

  Run the command 'submit_job /path_to_job_folder/xgboost_evaluate_global' on the admin console, replacing the 
  '/path_to_job_folder/xgboost_evaluate_global' to the absolute path of the xgboost_evaluate_global job folder.

  After the job folder is submitted, it will display 'Submitted job' followed by the job id and you can observe
  the server and clients performing the evaluation.
